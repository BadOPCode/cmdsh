cmdsh
=====

A simple command shell to simplify hard to remember command lines.

Introduction
------------
This utility is designed for simplifying tasks that you always forget those little naunces.  It allows you to make modules where you can store functions and provides a help system that you can access.
I created this project so I didn't have to memorize all those Git and SVN commands.  I could just make a module SVN and than put in all the naunce command with parameters that I needed for tasks.  The advantage to the shell over traditional BASSH scripting is that in the BASH scripts I tend to forget that I wrote a script to do the job and/or don't remmber what I named the script.
But with cmdsh I have a list of functions broken up by modules with descriptionss along the way.
I think a lot of people regardless of their skillset can benefit from cmdsh.
